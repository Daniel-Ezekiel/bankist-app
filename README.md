A banking application MVP where a customer can log in, make transactions between other customers, request a loan or even terminate their own account. In the event that a customer is inactive for a set period (they don't make any transactions), the customer gets logged out and they need to sign in once more.

## Lessons Learned

Implemented multiple logic to manipulate an objects and display the correct customer information after performing different operations on the customer dashboard. Also, worked with dates and timers, to log the user out in the event of inactivity. Display dates and numbers in different formats based on locales using the [Internationalization API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl)
